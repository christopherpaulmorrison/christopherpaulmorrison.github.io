          <p>There's a certain vulnerability to sharing your work before it's ready. The rough edges are visible. The half-formed ideas are exposed. And yet, the feedback loops you create by building in public are worth far more than the comfort of secrecy.</p>

          <h2>The case for transparency</h2>

          <p>When I started sharing my projects openly — committing messy code, posting work-in-progress screenshots, writing about decisions before I was sure they were right — something shifted. Not in the work itself, but in how I approached it.</p>

          <p>Building in public forces a kind of intellectual honesty. You can't hide behind vague descriptions of what you're "planning to do." The commit history tells the real story. And that story, imperfect as it is, resonates with people in ways that polished announcements never do.</p>

          <blockquote>
            The best time to share your work is before you think it's ready. The second best time is now.
          </blockquote>

          <h2>What I've learned</h2>

          <p>Over the past few years, I've settled into a rhythm. Here's what I've found works:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Share the process, not just the product.</strong> People learn more from watching you solve a problem than from seeing the finished solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Be specific about trade-offs.</strong> Every decision closes a door. Name the doors you're closing and explain why.</li>
            <li><strong>Invite critique early.</strong> The cost of changing direction increases exponentially over time. Catch bad assumptions when they're cheap to fix.</li>
            <li><strong>Document your reasoning.</strong> Future you (and future collaborators) will thank you for writing down not just <em>what</em> you decided, but <em>why</em>.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The uncomfortable middle</h2>

          <p>There's a phase in every project I call "the uncomfortable middle." The initial excitement has faded. The finish line isn't visible yet. This is precisely when building in public matters most.</p>

          <p>Public accountability — even to a small audience — creates just enough friction to keep you moving. Not the pressure of a deadline, but the gentle pull of people who are watching and rooting for you.</p>

          <p>I've abandoned plenty of private projects. The ones I've shared publicly? Those tend to get finished.</p>

          <h2>Starting small</h2>

          <p>You don't need an audience to build in public. A GitHub repository with thoughtful commit messages is building in public. A blog post explaining a technical decision is building in public. A simple tweet showing what you worked on today is building in public.</p>

          <p>The audience, if it comes, is a byproduct. The real benefit is the discipline it instills in you: to think clearly, to communicate deliberately, and to hold yourself to a standard you might otherwise let slip.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>If you're working on something — anything — consider opening the door. Let people in. The vulnerability is the point.</p>
